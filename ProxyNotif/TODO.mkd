There's always room for improvement.

Front-end
[ ] Make the template HTML5 compatible.
[ ] Improve the look of the page. (CSS, Backgrounds, fonts etc.)

Back-end
[ ] Add more usable info to the page. (What could this be?)
[ ] Improve the way we're checking for overall status
[ ] Get the code Peer-Reviewed? (Ha Ha Ha.)
