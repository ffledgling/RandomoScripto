Vim Wiki
--------

It's a wikipedia search plugin for vim, as you might've guessed from the name.
It's not very polished or fancy at the moment.

Hit \<F9\>It gives you the summary of whatever word you're currently on.

Unfortunately it doesn't do so in a separate buffer like it should.  
That will be fixed once I manage to get my head around buffers.  
In the meantime this'll have to do.

Requirements
------------

Vim compiled with python support, and that's about it.


Notes
-----

This plugin can be improved, critique and suggestions welcome.
